# Customer Segmentation with Clustering
 # Overview
This project uses clustering techniques to segment customers based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and Interpurchase Time metrics, enabling insights into customer behavior.

# Techniques
- **KMeans**: Achieved Silhouette Score of 0.94.
- **DBSCAN**: Tuned parameters for a Silhouette Score of 0.86.
- **Agglomerative Clustering**: Scored 0.89 using hierarchical methods.
# Workflow
* Imported and cleaned data.
* Performed exploratory data analysis to identify patterns.
* Created RFM and Interpurchase Time features.
* Applied clustering algorithms to segment customers.
* Evaluated models and visualized results.
